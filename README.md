CCC - Coin Control Center
===

CCC lets you follow the prices of multiple crypto currencies in (well nearly) real-time through the public API's of several exchanges.
All the information is rendered in a Graph (work in progress) and in a table, no need having multiple browser tabs open anymore!
You can also set trigger warnings, which will result in an Email or a Popup Alert.

Screenshots are found here:

See builds for compiled Jars (tested with OSX 10.8 & Windows 8.1 & Ubuntu 13.10), no installation is required.

CCC is being developed by Luca Tännler, Diego Etter and Oussama Zgheb during the software engineering project 2 class (up to version 1.1) at the "Hochschule für Technik in Rapperswil" (Switzerland).

The best thing, it’s completely free as in freedom, GPLv3!

Please report bugs, ideas and even commit some code yourself.
